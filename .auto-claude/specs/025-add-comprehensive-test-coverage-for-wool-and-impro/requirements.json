  "task_description": "Address missing test coverage areas identified in bughunt_main_261225.md:\n\n1. **Wool Package Tests** - Currently has no test suite defined:\n   - Add unit tests for agent type definitions\n   - Test role configurations and capabilities\n   - Validate agent metadata structures\n   - Test serialization/deserialization of agent definitions\n\n2. **Weaver Spinner Tests** - Fix 3 failing tests related to terminal color detection:\n   - Fix TestSpinner_StartStop failure\n   - Fix TestSpinner_UpdateMessage failure  \n   - Fix TestSpinner_Concurrent failure\n   - Ensure proper terminal capability detection across environments\n\n3. **TheLoom GPU-Independent Tests** - Separate GPU-required from unit tests:\n   - Mark GPU-dependent tests appropriately (33 failures, 14 errors)\n   - Create mock/stub tests for server geometry endpoints\n   - Add unit tests for utility functions that don't require GPU\n   - Ensure CI can run non-GPU tests successfully\n\n4. **E2E Test Harness** - Implement the full-stack testing plan from the bug hunt:\n   - Automate the manual testing steps outlined in section 5\n   - Create integration test suite for Senior/Junior delegation\n   - Add tests for hidden state extraction workflow\n   - Validate conveyance measurement calculations\n\nSuccess criteria: \n- Wool test coverage > 80%\n- All Weaver spinner tests passing\n- Clear separation of GPU-required vs unit tests in TheLoom\n- Automated E2E test suite that can run without manual intervention",
