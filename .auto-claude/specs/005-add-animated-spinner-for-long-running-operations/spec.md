# Add animated spinner for long-running operations

## Overview

Replace static 'thinking...' text with an animated spinner that shows progress and can display elapsed time. This provides better visual feedback during agent responses, concept extraction, and analysis operations.

## Rationale

Static text like 'thinking...' provides no feedback about operation progress. An animated spinner (similar to tools like npm, git, or docker) shows that the application is still working and hasn't frozen, improving perceived responsiveness and user confidence.
