// Package yarn manages conversations, measurements, and research session data.
//
// Yarn is the thread that connects everything - tracking WHAT HAPPENED in
// agent interactions. Just as yarn forms the continuous thread in a tapestry,
// this package weaves together the record of communication: the messages
// exchanged, the hidden states captured, and the conveyance metrics measured.
//
// The package provides the core data model for the Weaver research ecosystem,
// enabling systematic study of how meaning transfers between language models.
// It captures both the observable text of conversations and the internal
// representations (hidden states) that reveal the semantic structure beneath.
