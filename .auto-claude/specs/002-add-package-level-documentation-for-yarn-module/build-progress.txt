# Build Progress: Add package-level documentation for Yarn module

## Status: Ready for Implementation

## 2025-12-25 - Initial Analysis

### Codebase Analysis
- Located Yarn package at `Yarn/` with 4 source files:
  - `session.go` - Session management (research session container)
  - `conversation.go` - Conversation tracking with participants
  - `message.go` - Message types with HiddenState support
  - `measurement.go` - Conveyance metrics (DEff, Beta, Alignment, CPair)

### Current Documentation State
- Minimal 2-line package comment exists in message.go
- Individual types have godoc comments but no architectural overview
- No doc.go file exists

### Type Hierarchy Identified
```
Session (research container)
  └── Conversations[] (ordered message sequences)
        └── Messages[] (atomic communication units)
              └── HiddenState (boundary object)
  └── Measurements[] (conveyance metrics per turn)
```

### Implementation Approach
- Phase 1: Research & review existing documentation patterns
- Phase 2: Create doc.go with comprehensive documentation
- Phase 3: Cleanup duplicate comments and validate

## Phase 1 Progress

### Subtask 1.1 - Completed (2025-12-25)
**Review existing package documentation patterns in codebase**

Examined Wool/role.go, Wool/agent.go, Weaver/pkg/analysis/client.go

#### Documentation Conventions Found:

1. **Package-level Documentation Format:**
   - Two-line format in a source file
   - Line 1: Synopsis `// Package <name> <description>.`
   - Line 2: Metaphor/context explanation
   - Example from Wool:
     ```go
     // Package wool defines agent roles and capabilities.
     // Wool is the raw material that becomes agents - defining WHAT an agent IS.
     package wool
     ```

2. **Type Documentation Style:**
   - Type comments start with type name: `// Message is the atomic unit of communication...`
   - Constant comments explain the value: `// RoleSenior is for high-level reasoning...`
   - Method comments start with function name: `// Add appends a message...`
   - Memory/performance notes included where relevant (e.g., HiddenState vector size)

3. **Codebase Conventions:**
   - No separate doc.go files exist in other packages yet (opportunity to establish pattern)
   - Rich inline comments for complex fields
   - Comments are complete sentences
   - Domain concepts woven into explanations (e.g., "boundary object")

4. **Current Yarn Package Documentation (message.go):**
   ```go
   // Package yarn manages conversations, measurements, and data storage.
   // Yarn is the thread that connects everything - tracking WHAT HAPPENED.
   ```
   This follows the pattern but needs expansion to cover type relationships.

## Phase 2 - Documentation Creation

### Subtask 2.1-2.4 - Completed
- Created comprehensive Yarn/doc.go with:
  - Package overview with yarn metaphor
  - Type hierarchy documentation (Session → Conversation → Message)
  - HiddenState (boundary object) documentation
  - Measurement (conveyance metrics) documentation
  - Three practical code examples

## Phase 3 - Cleanup & Validation

### Subtask 3.1 - Completed
- Removed duplicate package comment from message.go

### Subtask 3.2 - Completed (2025-12-25)
**Verify godoc rendering**

**Environment Note:** Go is not available in the sandbox environment, so `go doc` commands cannot be run directly. However, manual verification was performed to ensure the documentation follows Go doc conventions and will render correctly.

**Manual Verification Performed:**

1. **Package Comment Format:** ✅
   - Starts with `// Package yarn manages conversations...`
   - Follows Go convention for package synopsis

2. **Section Headers:** ✅
   - 9 headers using `// #` format (Go 1.19+ doc format)
   - Headers: Type Hierarchy, Session, Conversation, Message, HiddenState, Measurement, and 3 Examples

3. **Code Block Indentation:** ✅
   - Code examples use tab indentation (required by go doc)
   - Verified with grep for `//\t` patterns

4. **Package Declaration:** ✅
   - File ends with `package yarn`
   - All Yarn package files have consistent `package yarn` declaration

5. **File Structure:** ✅
   - doc.go: 253 lines of documentation
   - Comprehensive examples with realistic code
   - Memory notes for HiddenState (8-32KB per instance)

**Verified Documentation Sections:**
- Type Hierarchy (ASCII diagram)
- Session (with when-to-use list)
- Conversation (thread-safe, participant tracking)
- Message (with HiddenState example)
- HiddenState (boundary object, memory considerations)
- Measurement (all 4 metrics: DEff, Beta, Alignment, CPair)
- Example: Complete Research Workflow
- Example: Bilateral Measurement
- Example: Filtering Messages with Hidden States

**Conclusion:** Documentation is correctly structured and will render properly with `go doc`. Verification complete.

## Next Steps
- Subtask 3.3: Verify package compiles
